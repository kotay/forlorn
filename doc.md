Welcome to Sirport.me

The purpose of this application is to be a close companion to Sirportly. Sir Portly is a busy man, ensuring
your helpdesk is all that you need it to be. Sometimes he just can't commit to those handy little extra things you ask of him.

That's where Sirport.me comes in.

Sir Portly has enlisted the help of many of his trusty workers for you to call upon and manage on your own.

The idea is simple, this handshake application facilitates all sorts of interactions with 
your Sirportly instance as well as connecting your much loved helpdesk to other services you
may use.

Each connector is performed by one of Sirportly's hard workers and each worker 
can receive, manipulate and send information, including shaking hands with other workers.

Need reports sent to you every week? You will want to enlist the help of the Report Digest Worker.
He can be set up to run weekly, daily or whenever really.

The trigger worker can be used to call other workers only on certain conditions.

Want a dataframe to know more about the ticket being looked at? No problem, use the Dataframe Source Worker to prepare a tailored
payload to send to a third party before responding to Sirportly's data frame request, you can even call another worker.

The great thing is you can write your own worker (and share it if you wish). Just read our documentation.
